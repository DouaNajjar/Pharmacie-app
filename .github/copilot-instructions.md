# Copilot / AI agent instructions for `medical-app`

Purpose: give an AI coding agent the minimal, actionable context to be productive in this Expo React Native project.

**Quick Start**

- **Install deps:** `npm install` (uses `package.json`).
- **Run (dev):** `npm start` (runs `expo start`). For device/emulator: `npm run android` / `npm run ios` / `npm run web`.

**Big Picture / Architecture**

- This is an Expo-managed React Native app. Primary entry points: `index.js` and `App.js`.
- UI/navigation: project depends on `@react-navigation/native`, `@react-navigation/stack`, and `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` — expect screens and navigators organized under a `screens/` or `navigation/` directory (search for imports of `@react-navigation`).
- State & persistence: `zustand` is used for in-memory state; persistent storage uses `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`. When changing state flows, update both the zustand store and any serialization to AsyncStorage.
- Assets: static images and fonts live in `assets/`. Reference them via `require('./assets/...')`.

**Key files to inspect when making changes**

- `App.js` — main app component / root navigator bootstrap.
- `index.js` — app entry registered with Expo/React Native.
- `package.json` — scripts and dependency list (useful for adding commands or tooling).
- `app.json` — Expo app configuration.
- Any files that import `zustand`, `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`, or `@react-navigation` — these indicate stores, persistence logic, or navigation.

**Project-specific patterns & conventions**

- Uses Expo standard scripts (`start`, `android`, `ios`, `web`) — use those rather than invoking `react-native` directly.
- Prefer adding new screens under a `screens/` directory and wire them into the existing navigator (look for files that import from `@react-navigation/*`).
- For persistent state, mirror zustand state keys to AsyncStorage with clear serializer/deserializer functions — search the repo for `AsyncStorage` usage to follow existing keys and JSON formats.

**Debugging & developer workflows**

- Use `npm start` to open Expo DevTools; reproduce issues on simulator/device from there.
- To view logs: run `expo start` and use the terminal output or attached emulator logs. For deeper native logs use the device/emulator tools (Android Logcat, Xcode console) if needed.

**Integration points & dependencies**

- Navigation: `@react-navigation/*` packages — changing routes may require updating both stack and bottom-tab configs.
- Persistence: `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` — be conservative when migrating keys; provide backward-compatible migrations if format changes.
- UUIDs: `react-native-uuid` used for generating ids — reuse to keep identifiers consistent.

**Examples (how to edit / add a feature)**

- Adding a screen: create `screens/MyScreen.js`, export a React component, then import and register it in the navigator component (search for `createStackNavigator` or `createBottomTabNavigator`).
- Adding persisted state: add fields to the zustand store, then update any save/load helpers that call `AsyncStorage.getItem`/`setItem`.

**What not to assume**

- There are no test scripts in `package.json`; do not add or run tests unless the repo contains test config files.
- No CI config or linter presets were found — do not add assumptions about CI workflows.

If anything here is unclear or you want this file to include examples from a particular module (for example, a specific store or navigator), tell me which files and I'll add targeted snippets.
